        <h3>What is Interface and Application Programming?</h3>
        <p>
        An application interface or user interface is the set of features an application provides so that a user may supply input to and receive output from the program.
        For this assignment, we are tasked to write an application that interfaces the user with an input or output device that we made.
        </p>
        <h3>Download software</h3>
        <p>In this assignment, I will be using Processing 4.0.1 which can downloaded from <a href="https://processing.org/download">here</a>
        After downloading, I will have to extract the zip file in order to open Processing.exe</p>
        <h3>First program</h3>
        <p>Inside the website there are multiple tutorial for us to learn. Below is an example of a tutorial code.</p>
        <img src="Img/Interface and Application/circlesandcode.png">
        <h3>What does the code do?</h3>
        <p>This program creates a window that is 480 pixels wide and 120 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse.
            When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. 
        </p>
        <h3>Second program</h3>
        <p>The second program we did was to code a led light up whenever the pushbutton is being pressed. </p>
        <p>Arduino Code: The code is obtain from <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/electronics#controlling-physical-media%20%3E">here</a></p>
        <p>Serial.swap(1) was added to change the Txd & Rxd ports to the alternative serial ports</p>

        <p>Python Code</p>
        <img src="Img/Interface and Application/python.png">
        <p>Command Prompt</p>
        <p>Because my python file is located in Downloads so I have to do CD Downloads than I have to do DIR *py to find the file.
            When excuting the code I need to do python (filename).py in this case my file name is LED so I just type python LED.py and press enter. 
            An error occured after I pressed enter.
        </p>
        <img src="Img/Interface and Application/load.png">
        <p>After troubleshooting I realised I did not install pyserial so I did pip install pyserial. after installing the code I was able to excute the code without any error</p>
